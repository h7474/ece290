The source material for the ECE~290 notes and slides is now open-sourced via Github. 

If you find an error in the notes/slides, or have an improvement, go to \url{https://github.com/jzarnett/ece290} and open an issue. 

If you know how to use \texttt{git} and \LaTeX, then you can go to the URL and submit a pull request (changes) for me to look at and incorporate!
