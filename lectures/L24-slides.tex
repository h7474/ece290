\frametitle{Mistakes}

Engineers are human beings -- they make mistakes.

We cannot expect engineers to be perfect, but the goal is to minimize the effects and create a culture and work environment that reduces the chance of errors.

Some mistakes and problems will be unavoidable.

Prior to the construction of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, no engineer considered wind as a possible factor in the construction of a suspension bridge.

The first Apollo mission saw the astronauts almost destroy the control panel when they loosened their straps.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mistakes}

Mistakes can sometimes come from carelessness, poor practice, negligence...

We will start by looking at the mistakes made in the Quebec Railway Bridge.

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/suspension-bridge-principle}
\end{center}

The design was a cantilever bridge: the lower members (steel beams) are under compression; the upper members in tension.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Quebec Bridge is Falling Down...}

The principle of cantilever bridges is sound; they're used all over the world.\\
\quad Including as the replacement for the bridge that failed!

What might be some other causes of failure?

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Manufacturing of the Steel}

As only half the bridge was built, it was possible to inspect the steel support beams still in fabrication.

\vspace{5em}

\begin{quote}
The work done by the Phoenix Bridge Company in making the detail drawings and in planning and carrying out the erection and by the Phoenix Iron Company in fabricating the material was good, and the steel used was of good quality.  
\end{quote}

So it isn't that. But, are engineers responsible for checking these things?

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Penny-Wise, Pound-Foolish}

There was insufficient money to perform anything more than the absolute minimum number tests required.


Engineering is not about getting the job done at the cheapest possible rate -- it's about reasonable pay for competent engineering work.


A practitioner shall uphold the principle of adequate compensation for engineering work.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Designer}

Cooper had designed bridges across North America before...

Cooper, however, was almost 70 years old at the time of the disaster and had only visited the construction site twice.

An engineer can have his or her licence revoked, suspended or limited in cases where the practitioner is found incompetent.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Don't Ignore the Warnings}

There were bent members for almost a month prior to the collapse and workers were skipping work rather than work on a bridge they felt was dangerous.


Listen to your contractors and workers:  you might have an engineering degree, but they will, at least for a few decades, more experience than you.

Do not be embarrassed if you make a mistake -- contractors know engineers are human, too, and they appreciate it when they acknowledge their mistakes...

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{This isn't supposed to bend...}

The engineers all argued as to the cause of the bent members even though the inspectors stated that they were true (straight) when installed.

Theories:
\begin{itemize}
 \item They were bent while they were being built in Phoenix.
 \item They were damaged while being unloaded from the trains.
 \item They were damaged while being installed.
\end{itemize}

None of which were correct...

Norman McLure was the only engineer who recognized the danger.

Engineers must co-operate in working with other professionals engaged on a project and act towards them with courtesy and good faith.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{So Pretty}

Cooper had curved members added to the structure for aesthetic reasons.

These increased the secondary stresses and added difficulties to fabrication.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/curved-beams}
\end{center}

The most important thing must always be public safety, not how ``pretty'' it is.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Final Plans}

No set of final designs was ever prepared -- all work was based on designs that had modifications and calculations using different notations.

This can lead to tremendous confusion and disarray.

Any final designs, plans, drawings, or any other document must be sealed, dated and signed by the engineer.


Contractors and officials are taught that a drawing should only be relied upon if it has been correctly sealed.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Competence}

The failure on the part of the Quebec Bridge and Railway Company to appoint an experienced bridge engineer to the position of chief engineer was a mistake.


Hoare restarted work after Norman McLure stopped construction two days prior to the collapse.


Hoare seemed to be more interested in maintaining the schedule.


An engineer should not undertake work the practitioner is not competent to perform by virtue of the practitioner's training and experience.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Check Yourself...}

The bridge was designed by Szlapka, the chief designer for Phoenix.

Cooper approved this design without thoroughly checking the calculations.


It is wrong to seal any final drawing, specification, plan, report or other document not actually prepared or checked by the practitioner!


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Egos}

Cooper refused to submit his designs to an engineer who would have been appointed by the Ministry of Railways and Canals.

Cooper claimed this would undermine his authority.

Engineers must understand it does not undermine their authority to have someone else validate their work.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Incompetence}

The Discipline Committee may find a member of the Association or a holder of a temporary licence, a provisional licence or a limited licence to be incompetent if in its opinion,

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item the member or holder has displayed in his or her professional responsibilities a lack of knowledge, skill or judgment or disregard for the welfare of the public of a nature or to an extent that demonstrates the member or holder is unfit to carry out the responsibilities of a professional engineer; or
\item the member or holder is suffering from a physical or mental condition or disorder of a nature and extent making it desirable in the interests of the public or the member or holder that the member or holder no longer be permitted to engage in the practice of professional engineering or that his or her practice of professional engineering be restricted. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Professional Misconduct}

As a consequence of a number of engineering disasters, behaviour detrimental to acceptable practice has been collectively labeled \alert{professional misconduct}.

Section 72 (2) of O.Reg. 941 gives the definition of professional misconduct.
